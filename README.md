# Microtransaction-Prediction-IDS25
##### Authors: Patrick Tiit Raal, Rander Erich Pikkani, Marten Peljo

### Introduction: <br>
Nowadays, many video game companies rely on small in-game purchases—microtransactions—as their primary source of revenue.<br>
If a company could predict which players are more likely to make a purchase, they could better tailor the in-game offers and decide who to show them to.<br><br>

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that determines whether a player will make an in-game purchase, in order to better target players based on their gameplay behavior, engagement metrics, and contextual attributes.<br><br>

For data, we used a dataset from Kaggle.<br>

### Project overview:<br><br>

1. Setup and introduction<br>
First, we import all necessary libraries and display some aspects of the raw data.<br><br>

2. Data cleaning and preprocessing<br>
Next, we prepare the data for machine learning:<br>
– Handling missing values<br>
– Encoding categorical variables<br>
– Dropping unnecessary columns<br>
– Splitting the data into training and testing sets<br><br>

3. Model training<br>
We train several models, specifically different variations of:<br>
– Logistic Regression<br>
– Random Forest<br>
– EasyEnsemble<br><br>

4. Model evaluation<br>
Finally, we compare the models, look at feature importance and discuss the results, while using charts for better understanding.<br><br>

### How to Replicate the Analysis:<br>
Clone the notebook and download the data.<br>
Run the notebook step by step—the notebook is structured linearly, allowing full reproducibility.<br>
Each section includes explanations and code comments that describe what was done and why it was used.<br>
